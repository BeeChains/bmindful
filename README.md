Thoughts of God are Divine Seeds sown in the Mind.

["God dwells in you, as you, and you don't have to 'do' anything to be God-realized or Self-realized, it is already your true and natural state." Just drop all seeking, turn your attention inward, and sacrifice your mind to the One Self radiating in the Heart of your very being. For this to be your own presently lived experience, Self-Inquiry is the one direct and immediate way."](https://peacefulrivers.homestead.com/Maharshi.html#:~:text="God%20dwells%20in%20you%2C%20as,Heart%20of%20your%20very%20being.&text=in%20quest%20of%20the%20Self%20is%20the%20best%20means) Sri Ramana Maharshi

 - It is unconditional love, total acceptance at the root level of sensation that allows one to Awaken to What Is.
 - The more that we think, the further we are moving away from the SOURCE of thought. 
 - A thought directed within initiates one into the Still Presence of SOURCE.
 - At the center, one can see the infinite.
 
 ["Brahman, is the very Self, the indivisible, pure, "I" ness, which is everywhere, in everything and around everything. There is no duality, division or dichotomy in Brahman. Brahman is one Supreme endless unitary feeling of "I" ness. That "I"ness is pure, immutable, indivisible and universal in Brahman, but manifests in the field of Nature as selfishness and egoism."](https://www.hinduwebsite.com/who_is_brahman.asp)
